----------How to-----------
* If you get a Error at line 8 please install the library "time"
* Due to programming and file limitations (or just laziness!) typing a option that does not exist (Like typing cheese to select a class) will crash the game.
* Options are usually inside brackets, like this -> [1] or [2]
